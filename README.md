Using Machine Learning to dicover new drugs that target COVID-19.

## Introduction

We develop statistical machine learning models for virtual screening of ligands that will inhibit [SARS-CoV-2 main protease](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/242), a viral enzyme required for maturation.

## Dataset 

We are using [data](https://covid.postera.ai/covid/activity_data) from the [Covid Moonshot](https://postera.ai/moonshot) project.
